	You can, after construction, perform `in` queries such as:
	
		if 'admin' in context.permissions: ...
	
	Useful in concert with the `when.contains` predicate:
	
		has = when.contains.partial(True, 'permissions')
		has('admin')
	
	May be added to, extended, or updated, but only reads trigger collection from configured `PermissionSource`
	instances:
	
		context.permissions.add('potato')
	
	Removal via `remove` requires population, `clear` does not.  You can also easily iterate the available flags, for
	example to by passing to `list`, `set`, or `tuple`. Permissions are iterated in sorted order. No manipulation
	method will raise an exception, and each returns `self` to allow method chaining.
